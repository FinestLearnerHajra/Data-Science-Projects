The order of the lectures can be explained as follows:

- Classes and error handling are done right away, as they are needed in the unittest demo;
- Unittest comes next
- Then a couple of 'advanced features' of the core language: lambdas and comprehensions
- Then SQLite
- Finally some additional OOP features (which may be skipped if there's no time): encapsulation and inheritance
